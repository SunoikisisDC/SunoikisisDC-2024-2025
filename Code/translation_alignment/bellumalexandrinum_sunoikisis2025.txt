Anonymous (Pseudo Caesar), De Bello Alexandrino. 1.1-1.3

Latin: 

1.1. Bello Alexandrino conflato Caesar Rhodo atque ex Syria Ciliciaque omnem classem arcessit. Creta sagittarios, equites ab rege Nabataeorum Malcho euocat. Tormenta undique conquiri et frumentum mitti auxilia adduci iubet.
1.2. Interim munitiones cotidie operibus augentur atque omnes oppidi partes quae minus esse firmae uidentur testudinibus ac musculis aptantur. Ex aedificiis autem per foramina in proxima aedificia arietes immittuntur, quantumque aut ruinis deicitur aut per uim recipitur loci in tantum munitiones proferuntur.
1.3. Nam ⟦ab⟧ incendio fere tuta est Alexandria quod sine contignatione ac materia sunt aedificia et structuris ac fornicibus continentur tectaque sunt rudere aut pauimentis.

English: 

1.1. With the kindling of the Alexandrian War Caesar summoned his whole fleet from Rhodes and from Syria and Cilicia. He called up archers from Crete, cavalry from Malchus, king of the Nabataeans. He ordered siege engines to be collected from everywhere, grain to be sent, and reinforcements to be brought.
1.2. In the meantime his fortifications were being strengthened every day with defensive works, and every part of the town that seemed to be less secure was being furnished with overhead shelters and covered galleries. Battering rams were carried from buildings into neighboring buildings through holes, and the fortifications were extended into all of the territory that was either cast down in ruins or taken by force.
1.3. For Alexandria is mostly safe from fire, since the buildings lack wooden flooring and are held together by masonry and vaulted structures and covered with rubble and tiles.
